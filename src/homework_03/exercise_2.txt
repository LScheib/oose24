To arrange the top-level components of Klipsias and define their interfaces, we'll consider how these components interact with
each other and what kind of data or functionality they might need to exchange. Here's a structured approach to defining the interfaces:

1. Calendar
    Provided Interfaces:
        EventDisplay: Provides functionality to display both regular and irregular events to the user.
    Required Interfaces:
        UserData: Requires access to user data to determine relevancy of events.
        RoomBookingData: Requires access to room booking data to display booked events.
2. Grades

    Provided Interfaces:
        GradeManagement: Allows for the input, update, and retrieval of student grades.
    Required Interfaces:
        UserData: Needs user data to associate grades with specific students.
        CourseData: Needs course data to associate grades with specific courses.
3. Users

    Provided Interfaces:
        UserData: Manages and provides user data and authentication status.
    Required Interfaces:
        None. This component primarily serves other components.
4. Materials

    Provided Interfaces:
        MaterialAccess: Provides access to educational materials and presentations.
    Required Interfaces:
        CourseData: Requires course data to associate materials with specific courses.
5. Courses

    Provided Interfaces:
        CourseData: Provides information about courses, including schedules, syllabi, and associated materials.
    Required Interfaces:
        UserData: May require user data to manage course enrollments and permissions.
6. RoomBooking

    Provided Interfaces:
        RoomBookingData: Allows users to book rooms and provides data on current bookings.
    Required Interfaces:
        UserData: Requires user data to manage booking permissions.
        CalendarData: May need access to calendar data to avoid scheduling conflicts.

7. Exams
    Provided Interfaces:
        ExamManagement: Manages exam schedules, formats, and results.
    Required Interfaces:
        UserData: Needs user data to associate exams with students.
        CourseData: Requires course data to link exams with the corresponding courses.
        MaterialAccess: Optionally, for accessing or providing materials specific to the exam preparation.


Overview and Brief Descriptions of the Interfaces:
    EventDisplay: Used to show relevant events to users based on their roles and interests.
    GradeManagement: Facilitates the handling of student grades by teachers and administrators.
    UserData: Central to managing user profiles, authentication, and role-based access control.
    MaterialAccess: Ensures students and faculty have access to educational content.
    CourseData: Key for managing course-related information, such as schedules, materials, and enrollment.
    RoomBookingData: Enables the booking of rooms for various purposes, ensuring efficient space utilization.
    ExamManagement: Oversees all aspects of examinations, from scheduling to result dissemination.

This structure allows for clear separation of concerns among the components of Klipsias, facilitating maintenance and scalability.
