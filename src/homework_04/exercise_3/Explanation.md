# HW 4 Ex 3:
In this example we used three different Java features to minimize the code needed. First of all we used the Functional Interface instead of a regular interface in combination with lambda expressions which allows us to use lambda expressions to instantiate the interface directly without the need for an explicit class. This reduces the code needed to implement the Strategy pattern. Furthermore we are using a generic type in the Strategy interface as well as the Context class so that they are independant of the type of the input variables. This further decreases the amount of code needed to implement different strategies. By adding a setter of the private Strategy variable in the context class we also reduce the amount of object creations depending on the specific task at hand. One problem this code faces is, that we cannot add a new strategy without touching the code in the main method or wherever the strategies are instantiated and used. The Open-Closed principle is therefore hard to maintain without additional code. Another shortcoming of this code is that we are instantiating strategies wherever they are needed and may end up with duplicates of the same code. This should be exctracted from the main method and handled seperately. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
